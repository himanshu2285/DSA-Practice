# 🧠 Data Structures and Algorithms Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice repository!  
This repo contains structured solutions, notes, and implementations for key DSA topics — from fundamentals to advanced problem-solving.  

The main goal of this repository is to **solve 15–20 easy to medium-level problems** on each major topic to build strong problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## 🧠 Practice Strategy

- ✅ Solve **15–20 problems** per topic (Easy → Medium)  
- ✅ Maintain separate folders per topic with clean, commented code  
- ✅ Focus on understanding **approach**, not just the final code  
- ✅ Track progress using a markdown checklist or a spreadsheet  
- ✅ Revise weekly and attempt mixed-topic challenges  

---

## 🌍 Additional Notes

> **"Trees and Graphs are the backbone of advanced systems like search engines, social networks, and navigation apps."**  
> Learn their **construction**, **traversal**, and **real-world applications** to strengthen your foundation for complex projects and interviews.

Also, keep exploring:
- Problem patterns (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Binary Search on Answer)
- Space optimization techniques in DP
- Recursion → Memoization → Tabulation conversions
